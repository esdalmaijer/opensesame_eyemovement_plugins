OpenSesame eye movement plugins

ABOUT
These are OpenSesame plugins to implement simple stimulus presentation often used in eye movement research and EMDR experiments. They are created for the department of Clinical and Health Psychology of Utrecht University, to be used in EMDR research.

SMOOTH PURSUIT
The smooth_pursuit plugin presents a moving dot. The movement type can be either sinusoidal or linear, the direction can be either horizontal or vertical and both the frequency and amplitude can be adjusted. The stimulus size and colour are user defined as well. Furthermore, there is an option to allow for keyboard responses during the stimulus movement.

SACCADE
The saccade plugin works the same as the smooth_pursuit plugin with respect to the GUI. It shows a stimulus alternating between two points at a given amplitude, with a given frequency.

FUTURE
Options to be added in the future: 
- stimulus movements in any direction, by giving in a value in degrees
- random interval option for saccade stimulus
